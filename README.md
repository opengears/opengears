### Hi there 👋

<!--
**opengears/opengears** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Welcome to Open Gears!
Here you find all the files you need to make your own Open Gears hardware: 
.dxf files to cut gears, .stl files to print axis rings, design guides etc.

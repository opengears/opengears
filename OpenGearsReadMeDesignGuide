Welcome to Open Gears!
Take a look at http://www.Open-Gears.com to see Open Gears in action!

Open-Gears is an open source construction toy. It aims to provide easy access to STEM fun! It is based around a set of wooden gears and readily available additions you can find at any hardware store or online: 
dowels, magnets and 3D printable connectors.

on this GitHub page you will find:

.DXF files of the gears, so you can have them CNC-ed on 6mm thick wood by your local CNC factory (or ponoko.com)
.STL files of the connectors, so you (or your neighbor) can 3D print your own connectors, or even design your own additional connectors.

when designing your own additions, please keep a few things in mind:
base your designs as much as possible around the following rules:
-use the standard available gears, with round holes of 10 mm in diameter
-use a cutting width of the CNC machine of .15 mm
-the width of the compatible magnets, dowels and rods are all 6 mm in diameter. the magnets are also 6mm in height.
-when using wooden rods use multiples of 10 mm in terms of length. so 60,70,80 mm etc.

Please note that you are not required to make your own designs open source. It would be appreciated if you share pictures of your results on any social platform using the hashtag: #OpenGears 
You might make it through the hall of fame on Open-Gears.com!

the whole idea is: the more Open Gears users/designers, the more additions to the ecosystem, the more users/designers/sellers etc..
